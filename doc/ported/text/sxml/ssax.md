[ยง2] (text sxml ssax) - Functional XML parser {#ported.text.sxml.ssax}
-------------

###### [!Library] `(text sxml ssax)` 

`(text sxml *)` libraries are the adaptation of Oleg Kiselyov's
SXML framework SSAX, which is based on S-expression representation of XML
structure.

SSAX is a parser part of SXML framework.

This is a quote from SSAX webpage:

> The framework consists of a DOM/SXML parser, a SAX parser, and a supporting
> library of lexing and parsing procedures. The procedures in the package can be
> used separately to tokenize or parse various pieces of XML documents. The
> framework supports XML Namespaces, character, internal and external parsed
> entities, xml:space, attribute value normalization, processing instructions and
> CDATA sections. The package includes a semi-validating SXML parser: a DOM-mode
> parser that is an instantiation of a SAX parser (called SSAX).
> The parsing framework offers support for XML validation, to the full or any
> user-specified degree. Framework's procedures by themselves detect great many
> validation errors and almost all well-formedness errors. Furthermore, a user is
> given a chance to set his own handlers to capture the rest of the errors.
> Content is validated given user-specified constraints, which the user can derive
> from a DTD, from an XML schema, or from other competing doctype specification
> formats.
> SSAX is a full-featured, algorithmically optimal, pure-functional parser, which
> can act as a stream processor. SSAX is an efficient SAX parser that is easy to
> use. SSAX minimizes the amount of application-specific state that has to be
> shared among user-supplied event handlers. SSAX makes the maintenance of an
> application-specific element stack unnecessary, which eliminates several classes
> of common bugs. SSAX is written in a pure-functional subset of Scheme. Therefore,
> the event handlers are referentially transparent, which makes them easier for a
> programmer to write and to reason about. The more expressive, reliable and easier
> to use application interface for the event-driven XML parsing is the outcome of
> implementing the parsing engine as an enhanced tree fold combinator, which fully
> captures the control pattern of the depth-first tree traversal.

Sagittarius supports the latest version of SSAX 5.1.


All procedures and macros are described bottom up. So you might be interested
only in user level APIs. If so, 
see [Highest-level parsers: XML to SXML](#ssax.user.api).


### [ยง3] Introduction

I derived the content of this part of the manual from SSAX source code, just by
converting its comments into this manual format. The original text is by Oleg
Kiselyov.

This is a package of low-to-high level lexing and parsing procedures
that can be combined to yield a SAX, a DOM, a validating parsers, or
a parser intended for a particular document type. The procedures in
the package can be used separately to tokenize or parse various
pieces of XML documents. The package supports XML Namespaces,
internal and external parsed entities, user-controlled handling of
whitespace, and validation. This module therefore is intended to be
a framework, a set of "Lego blocks" you can use to build a parser
following any discipline and performing validation to any degree. As
an example of the parser construction, this file includes a
semi-validating SXML parser.

The present XML framework has a "sequential" feel of SAX yet a
"functional style" of DOM. Like a SAX parser, the framework scans
the document only once and permits incremental processing. An
application that handles document elements in order can run as
efficiently as possible. _Unlike_ a SAX parser, the framework does
not require an application register stateful callbacks and surrender
control to the parser. Rather, it is the application that can drive
the framework -- calling its functions to get the current lexical or
syntax element. These functions do not maintain or mutate any state
save the input port. Therefore, the framework permits parsing of XML
in a pure functional style, with the input port being a monad (or a
linear, read-once parameter).

Besides the PORT, there is another monad -- SEED. Most of the
middle- and high-level parsers are single-threaded through the
seed. The functions of this framework do not process or affect the
SEED in any way: they simply pass it around as an instance of an
opaque datatype.  User functions, on the other hand, can use the
seed to maintain user's state, to accumulate parsing results, etc. A
user can freely mix his own functions with those of the
framework. On the other hand, the user may wish to instantiate a
high-level parser: ssax:make-elem-parser or ssax:make-parser.  In
the latter case, the user must provide functions of specific
signatures, which are called at predictable moments during the
parsing: to handle character data, element data, or processing
instructions (PI). The functions are always given the SEED, among
other parameters, and must return the new SEED.

From a functional point of view, XML parsing is a combined
pre-post-order traversal of a "tree" that is the XML document
itself. This down-and-up traversal tells the user about an element
when its start tag is encountered. The user is notified about the
element once more, after all element's children have been
handled. The process of XML parsing therefore is a fold over the
raw XML document. Unlike a fold over trees defined in [1], the
parser is necessarily single-threaded -- obviously as elements
in a text XML document are laid down sequentially. The parser
therefore is a tree fold that has been transformed to accept an
accumulating parameter [1,2].

Formally, the denotational semantics of the parser can be expressed
as

``````````scheme
parser:: (Start-tag -> Seed -> Seed) ->
	 (Start-tag -> Seed -> Seed -> Seed) ->
	 (Char-Data -> Seed -> Seed) ->
	 XML-text-fragment -> Seed -> Seed

parser fdown fup fchar "<elem attrs> content </elem>" seed
 = fup "<elem attrs>" seed
	(parser fdown fup fchar "content" (fdown "<elem attrs>" seed))

parser fdown fup fchar "char-data content" seed
 = parser fdown fup fchar "content" (fchar "char-data" seed)

parser fdown fup fchar "elem-content content" seed
 = parser fdown fup fchar "content" (
	parser fdown fup fchar "elem-content" seed)
``````````

Compare the last two equations with the left fold
fold-left kons elem:list seed = fold-left kons list (kons elem seed)

The real parser created my ssax:make-parser is slightly more complicated,
to account for processing instructions, entity references, namespaces,
processing of document type declaration, etc.


The XML standard document referred to in this module is
[http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-xml-19980210.html](http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-xml-19980210.html)The present file also defines a procedure that parses the text of an
XML document or of a separate element into SXML, an
S-expression-based model of an XML Information Set. SXML is also an
Abstract Syntax Tree of an XML document. SXML is similar
but not identical to DOM; SXML is particularly suitable for
Scheme-based XML/HTML authoring, SXPath queries, and tree
transformations. See SXML.html for more details.
SXML is a term implementation of evaluation of the XML document [3].
The other implementation is context-passing.

The present frameworks fully supports the XML Namespaces Recommendation:

### [ยง3] Data Types

TAG-KIND
: a symbol `START`, `END`, `PI`, `DECL`, `COMMENT`,
  `CDSECT` or `ENTITY-REF` that identifies a markup token

UNRES-NAME
: a name (called GI in the XML Recommendation) as given in an xml
  document for a markup token: start-tag, PI target, attribute name.
  If a GI is an NCName, UNRES-NAME is this NCName converted into
  a Scheme symbol. If a GI is a QName, UNRES-NAME is a pair of
  symbols: (PREFIX . LOCALPART)

RES-NAME
: An expanded name, a resolved version of an UNRES-NAME.
  For an element or an attribute name with a non-empty namespace URI,
  RES-NAME is a pair of symbols, (URI-SYMB . LOCALPART).
  Otherwise, it's a single symbol.

ELEM-CONTENT-MODEL
: A symbol:
  ANY
  : anything goes, expect an END tag.
  EMPTY-TAG
  : no content, and no END-tag is coming
  EMPTY
  : no content, expect the END-tag as the next token
  PCDATA
  : expect character data only, and no children elements
  MIXED
  : 
  ELEM-CONTENT
  : 

URI-SYMB
: A symbol representing a namespace URI -- or other symbol chosen
  by the user to represent URI. In the former case,
  URI-SYMB is created by %-quoting of bad URI characters and
  converting the resulting string into a symbol.

NAMESPACES
: A list representing namespaces in effect. An element of the list
  has one of the following forms:
  : (PREFIX URI-SYMB . URI-SYMB)(PREFIX USER-PREFIX . URI-SYMB)		USER-PREFIX is a symbol chosen by the user
   		to represent the URI.
   	
  (#f USER-PREFIX . URI-SYMB)
  : Specification of the user-chosen prefix and a URI-SYMBOL.
  (\*DEFAULT\* USER-PREFIX . URI-SYMB)
  : Declaration of the default namespace
  (\*DEFAULT\* #f . #f)
  : Un-declaration of the default namespace. This notation
   represents overriding of the previous declaration
  A NAMESPACES list may contain several elements for the same PREFIX.
  The one closest to the beginning of the list takes effect.

ATTLIST
: An ordered collection of (NAME . VALUE) pairs, where NAME is
  a RES-NAME or an UNRES-NAME. The collection is an ADT

STR-HANDLER
: A procedure of three arguments: STRING1 STRING2 SEED
  returning a new SEED
  The procedure is supposed to handle a chunk of character data
  STRING1 followed by a chunk of character data STRING2.
  STRING2 is a short string, often "\\n" and even ""

ENTITIES
: An assoc list of pairs:
     ``(named-entity-name . named-entity-body)``
  where named-entity-name is a symbol under which the entity was
  declared, named-entity-body is either a string, or
  (for an external entity) a thunk that will return an
  input port (from which the entity can be read).
  named-entity-body may also be #f. This is an indication that a
  named-entity-name is currently being expanded. A reference to
  this named-entity-name will be an error: violation of the
  WFC nonrecursion.

XML-TOKEN
: a record
  This record represents a markup, which is, according to the XML
  Recommendation, "takes the form of start-tags, end-tags, empty-element tags,
  entity references, character references, comments, CDATA section delimiters,
  document type declarations, and processing instructions."
  kind
  : a TAG-KIND
  head
  : an UNRES-NAME. For xml-tokens of kinds 'COMMENT and
    		'CDSECT, the head is #f
  For example,
  ``````````scheme
  	<P>  => kind='START, head='P
  	</P> => kind='END, head='P
  	<BR/> => kind='EMPTY-EL, head='BR
  	<!DOCTYPE OMF ...> => kind='DECL, head='DOCTYPE
  	<?xml version="1.0"?> => kind='PI, head='xml
  	&my-ent; => kind = 'ENTITY-REF, head='my-ent
  ``````````
  Character references are not represented by xml-tokens as these references
  are transparently resolved into the corresponding characters.

XML-DECL
: a record
  The record represents a datatype of an XML document: the list of
  declared elements and their attributes, declared notations, list of
  replacement strings or loading procedures for parsed general
  entities, etc. Normally an xml-decl record is created from a DTD or
  an XML Schema, although it can be created and filled in in many other
  ways (e.g., loaded from a file).
  elems
  : an (assoc) list of decl-elem or #f. The latter instructs
    the parser to do no validation of elements and attributes.
  decl-elem
  : declaration of one element:
    ``(_elem-name_ _elem-content_ _decl-attrs_)``
    _elem-name_ is an UNRES-NAME for the element.
    _elem-content_ is an ELEM-CONTENT-MODEL.
    _decl-attrs_ is an ATTLIST, of (ATTR-NAME . VALUE) associations
    !!!This element can declare a user procedure to handle parsing of an
    element (e.g., to do a custom validation, or to build a hash of
    IDs as they're encountered).
  decl-attr
  : an element of an ATTLIST, declaration of one attribute
    ``(_attr-name_ _content-type_ _use-type_ _default-value_)``
    _attr-name_ is an UNRES-NAME for the declared attribute
    _content-type_ is a symbol: CDATA, NMTOKEN, NMTOKENS, ...		or a list of strings for the enumerated type.
    _use-type_ is a symbol: REQUIRED, IMPLIED, FIXED
    _default-value_ is a string for the default value, or #f if not given.

###### [!Function] `make-xml-token`  _kind_ _head_
###### [!Function] `xml-token?`  _kind_ _head_

A constructor and a predicate for a _XML-TOKEN_ record.

###### [!Macro] `xml-token-kind`  _xml-token_
###### [!Macro] `xml-token-head`  _xml-token_

Accessor macros of a _XML-TOKEN_ record.

### [ยง3] Lower-level parsers and scanners

They deal with primitive lexical units (Names, whitespaces, tags)
and with pieces of more generic productions. Most of these parsers
must be called in appropriate context. For example, ssax:complete-start-tag
must be called only when the start-tag has been detected and its GI
has been read.

#### [ยง4] Low-level parsing code

###### [!Function] `ssax:skip-S`  _port_

Skip the S (whitespace) production as defined by
``[3] S ::= (#x20 | #x9 | #xD | #xA)``

The procedure returns the first not-whitespace character it
encounters while scanning the _port_. This character is left
on the input stream.


###### [!Function] `ssax:ncname-starting-char?`  _a-char_

Read a Name lexem and return it as string

``````````scheme
[4] NameChar ::= Letter | Digit | '.' | '-' | '_' | ':'
                 | CombiningChar | Extender
[5] Name ::= (Letter | '_' | ':') (NameChar)*
``````````

This code supports the XML Namespace Recommendation REC-xml-names,
which modifies the above productions as follows:

``````````scheme
[4] NCNameChar ::= Letter | Digit | '.' | '-' | '_'
                      | CombiningChar | Extender
[5] NCName ::= (Letter | '_') (NCNameChar)*
``````````

As the Rec-xml-names says,
"An XML document conforms to this specification if all other tokens
[other than element types and attribute names] in the document which
are required, for XML conformance, to match the XML production for
Name, match this specification's production for NCName."
Element types and attribute names must match the production QName,
defined below.


###### [!Function] `ssax:read-NCName`  _port_

Read a NCName starting from the current position in the _port_ and
preturn it as a symbol.


###### [!Function] `ssax:read-QName`  _port_

Read a (namespace-) Qualified Name, QName, from the current
position in the _port_.

``````````scheme
From REC-xml-names:
	[6] QName ::= (Prefix ':')? LocalPart
	[7] Prefix ::= NCName
	[8] LocalPart ::= NCName
``````````

Return: an UNRES-NAME


###### [!Variable] `ssax:Prefix-XML` 

The prefix of the pre-defined XML namespace

###### [!Function] `name-compare`  _name1_ _name2_

Compare one RES-NAME or an UNRES-NAME with the other.
Return a symbol '\<, '>, or '= depending on the result of
the comparison.
Names without PREFIX are always smaller than those with the PREFIX.


###### [!Variable] `ssax:largest-unres-name` 

An UNRES-NAME that is postulated to be larger than anything that can occur in
a well-formed XML document.
name-compare enforces this postulate.


###### [!Function] `ssax:read-markup-token`  _port_

This procedure starts parsing of a markup token. The current position
in the stream must be #\\\<. This procedure scans enough of the input stream
to figure out what kind of a markup token it is seeing. The procedure returns
an xml-token structure describing the token. Note, generally reading
of the current markup is not finished! In particular, no attributes of
the start-tag token are scanned.

Here's a detailed break out of the return values and the position in the _port_when that particular value is returned:

PI-token
: only PI-target is read.
  To finish the Processing Instruction and disregard it,
  call ssax:skip-pi. ssax:read-attributes may be useful
  as well (for PIs whose content is attribute-value
  pairs)

END-token
: The end tag is read completely; the current position
  is right after the terminating #\\> character.

COMMENT
: is read and skipped completely. The current position
  is right after "-->" that terminates the comment.

CDSECT
: The current position is right after "\<!CDATA[" 			Use ssax:read-cdata-body to read the rest.

DECL
: We have read the keyword (the one that follows "\<!")
  identifying this declaration markup. The current
  position is after the keyword (usually a
  whitespace character)

START-token
: We have read the keyword (GI) of this start tag.
  No attributes are scanned yet. We don't know if this
  tag has an empty content either.
  Use ssax:complete-start-tag to finish parsing of
  the token.



###### [!Function] `ssax:skip-pi`  _port_

The current position is inside a PI. Skip till the rest of the PI

###### [!Function] `ssax:read-pi-body-as-string`  _port_

The current position is right after reading the PITarget. We read the
body of PI and return is as a string. The _port_ will point to the
character right after '?>' combination that terminates PI.
``[16] PI ::= '<?' PITarget (S (Char* - (Char* '?>' Char*)))? '?>'``



###### [!Function] `ssax:skip-internal-dtd`  _port_

The current pos in the port is inside an internal DTD subset
(e.g., after reading #\\[ that begins an internal DTD subset)
Skip until the "]>" combination that terminates this DTD


###### [!Function] `ssax:read-cdata-body`  _port_ _str-handler_ _seed_

This procedure must be called after we have read a string "\<![CDATA["
that begins a CDATA section. The current position must be the first
position of the CDATA body. This function reads _lines_ of the CDATA
body and passes them to a STR-HANDLER, a character data consumer.

The _str-handler_ is a STR-HANDLER, a procedure STRING1 STRING2 SEED.
The first STRING1 argument to STR-HANDLER never contains a newline.
The second STRING2 argument often will. On the first invocation of
the STR-HANDLER, the _seed_ is the one passed to `ssax:read-cdata-body`as the third argument. The result of this first invocation will be
passed as the _seed_ argument to the second invocation of the line
consumer, and so on. The result of the last invocation of the
STR-HANDLER is returned by the ssax:read-cdata-body.  Note a
similarity to the fundamental 'fold' iterator.

Within a CDATA section all characters are taken at their face value,
with only three exceptions:

- CR, LF, and CRLF are treated as line delimiters, and passed
- as a single #\\newline to the STR-HANDLER
- "]]>" combination is the end of the CDATA section.
- &gt; is treated as an embedded #\\> character

Note, &lt; and &amp; are not specially recognized (and are not expanded)!


###### [!Function] `ssax:read-char-ref`  _port_

``````````scheme
[66]  CharRef ::=  '&#' [0-9]+ ';' 
                 | '&#x' [0-9a-fA-F]+ ';'
``````````

This procedure must be called after we we have read "&#" 
that introduces a char reference.
The procedure reads this reference and returns the corresponding char
The current position in _port_ will be after ";" that terminates
the char reference

According to Section "4.1 Character and Entity References"
of the XML Recommendation:

> "[Definition: A character reference refers to a specific character
>  in the ISO/IEC 10646 character set, for example one not directly
>  accessible from available input devices.]"

Therefore, we use a ucscode->char function to convert a character
code into the character -- **\*regardless\*** of the current character
encoding of the input stream.


###### [!Function] `ssax:handle-parsed-entity`  _port_ _name_ _entities_ _comment-handler_ _str-handler_ _seed_

Expand and handle a parsed-entity reference

_port_ - a PORT

_name_ - the name of the parsed entity to expand, a symbol

_entities_ - see ENTITIES

_content-handler_ -- procedure PORT ENTITIES SEED
	that is supposed to return a SEED

_str-handler_ - a STR-HANDLER. It is called if the entity in question
turns out to be a pre-declared entity

The result is the one returned by CONTENT-HANDLER or STR-HANDLER

###### [!Function] `attlist-add`  _attlist_ _name-value_
###### [!Function] `attlist-null?`  _attlist_

###### [!Function] `attlist->alist`  _attlist_
###### [!Function] `attlist-fold`  _kons_ _knil_ _attlst_

Utility procedures to deal with attribute list, which keeps name-value association.

###### [!Function] `ssax:read-attributes`  _port_ _entities_

This procedure reads and parses a production Attribute\*

``````````scheme
[41] Attribute ::= Name Eq AttValue
[10] AttValue ::=  '"' ([^<&"] | Reference)* '"' 
                | "'" ([^<&'] | Reference)* "'"
[25] Eq ::= S? '=' S?
``````````

The procedure returns an ATTLIST, of Name (as UNRES-NAME), Value (as string)
pairs. The current character on the PORT is a non-whitespace character
that is not an ncname-starting character.

Note the following rules to keep in mind when reading an 'AttValue'
"Before the value of an attribute is passed to the application
or checked for validity, the XML processor must normalize it as follows: 

- a character reference is processed by appending the referenced
    character to the attribute value
- an entity reference is processed by recursively processing the
    replacement text of the entity [see ENTITIES]
    [named entities amp lt gt quot apos are assumed pre-declared]
- a whitespace character (#x20, #xD, #xA, #x9) is processed by appending #x20
    to the normalized value, except that only a single #x20 is appended for a
    "#xD#xA" sequence that is part of an external parsed entity or the
    literal entity value of an internal parsed entity
- other characters are processed by appending them to the normalized value

###### [!Function] `ssax:resolve-name`  _port_ _ures-name_ _namespace_ _apply-default-us?_

Convert an UNRES-NAME to a RES-NAME given the appropriate NAMESPACES
declarations.
the last parameter _apply-default-ns?_ determines if the default
namespace applies (for instance, it does not for attribute names)

Per REC-xml-names/#nsc-NSDeclared, "xml" prefix is considered pre-declared
and bound to the namespace name "http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace".

This procedure tests for the namespace constraints:
[http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/#nsc-NSDeclared](http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/#nsc-NSDeclared)

###### [!Function] `ssax:uri-string->symbol`  _uri-str_

Convert a URI-STR to an appropriate symbol

###### [!Function] `ssax:complete-start-tag`  _tag_ _port_ _elems_ _entities_ _namespaces_

This procedure is to complete parsing of a start-tag markup. The
procedure must be called after the start tag token has been
read. TAG is an UNRES-NAME. ELEMS is an instance of xml-decl::elems;
it can be #f to tell the function to do _no_ validation of elements
and their attributes.

This procedure returns several values:

ELEM-GI
: a RES-NAME.

ATTRIBUTES
: element's attributes, an ATTLIST of (RES-NAME . STRING)
  	pairs. The list does NOT include xmlns attributes.

NAMESPACES
: the input list of namespaces amended with namespace
  	(re-)declarations contained within the start-tag under parsing

ELEM-CONTENT-MODEL
: 

On exit, the current position in PORT will be the first character after
#\\> that terminates the start-tag markup.

###### [!Function] `ssax:read-external-id`  _port_

This procedure parses an ExternalID production:

``````````scheme
[75] ExternalID ::= 'SYSTEM' S SystemLiteral
		| 'PUBLIC' S PubidLiteral S SystemLiteral
[11] SystemLiteral ::= ('"' [^"]* '"') | ("'" [^']* "'") 
[12] PubidLiteral ::=  '"' PubidChar* '"' | "'" (PubidChar - "'")* "'"
[13] PubidChar ::=  #x20 | #xD | #xA | [a-zA-Z0-9]
                         | [-'()+,./:=?;!*#@$_%]
``````````

This procedure is supposed to be called when an ExternalID is expected;
that is, the current character must be either #\\S or #\\P that start
correspondingly a SYSTEM or PUBLIC token. This procedure returns the
SystemLiteral as a string. A PubidLiteral is disregarded if present.


#### [ยง4] Higher-level parsers and scanners

They parse productions corresponding to the whole (document) entity
or its higher-level pieces (prolog, root element, etc).

###### [!Function] `ssax:scan-Misc`  _port_

Scan the Misc production in the context

``````````scheme
[1]  document ::=  prolog element Misc*
[22] prolog ::= XMLDecl? Misc* (doctypedec l Misc*)?
[27] Misc ::= Comment | PI |  S
``````````

The following function should be called in the prolog or epilog contexts.
In these contexts, whitespaces are completely ignored.
The return value from ssax:scan-Misc is either a PI-token,
a DECL-token, a START token, or EOF.
Comments are ignored and not reported.


###### [!Function] `ssax:read-char-data`  _port_ _expected-eof?_ _str-handler_ _seed_

This procedure is to read the character content of an XML document
or an XML element.

``````````scheme
[43] content ::= 
	(element | CharData | Reference | CDSect | PI
	| Comment)*
``````````

To be more precise, the procedure reads CharData, expands CDSect
and character entities, and skips comments. The procedure stops
at a named reference, EOF, at the beginning of a PI or a start/end tag.

port
: a PORT to read

expect-eof?
: a boolean indicating if EOF is normal, i.e., the character
  data may be terminated by the EOF. EOF is normal
  while processing a parsed entity.

str-handler
: a STR-HANDLER

seed
: an argument passed to the first invocation of STR-HANDLER.

The procedure returns two results: SEED and TOKEN.
The SEED is the result of the last invocation of STR-HANDLER, or the
original seed if STR-HANDLER was never called.

TOKEN can be either an eof-object (this can happen only if
expect-eof? was #t), or:

- an xml-token describing a START tag or an END-tag;
  	For a start token, the caller has to finish reading it.
- an xml-token describing the beginning of a PI. It's up to an
  	application to read or skip through the rest of this PI;
- an xml-token describing a named entity reference.

CDATA sections and character references are expanded inline and
never returned. Comments are silently disregarded.

As the XML Recommendation requires, all whitespace in character data
must be preserved. However, a CR character (#xD) must be disregarded
if it appears before a LF character (#xA), or replaced by a #xA character
otherwise. See Secs. 2.10 and 2.11 of the XML Recommendation. See also
the canonical XML Recommendation.


###### [!Function] `ssax:assert-token`  _token_ _kind_ _gi_

Make sure that TOKEN is of anticipated KIND and has anticipated GI
Note GI argument may actually be a pair of two symbols, Namespace
URI or the prefix, and of the localname.
If the assertion fails, error-cont is evaluated by passing it
three arguments: token kind gi. The result of error-cont is returned.


### [ยง3] Highest-level parsers: XML to SXML

These parsers are a set of syntactic forms to instantiate a SSAX parser.
A user can instantiate the parser to do the full validation, or
no validation, or any particular validation. The user specifies
which PI he wants to be notified about. The user tells what to do
with the parsed character and element data. The latter handlers
determine if the parsing follows a SAX or a DOM model.

###### [!Macro] `ssax:make-pi-parser`  _my-pi-handlers_

Create a parser to parse and process one Processing Element (PI).

_my-pi-handlers_
: An assoc list of pairs (PI-TAG . PI-HANDLER)
  where PI-TAG is an NCName symbol, the PI target, and
  PI-HANDLER is a procedure PORT PI-TAG SEED
  where PORT points to the first symbol after the PI target.
  The handler should read the rest of the PI up to and including
  the combination '?>' that terminates the PI. The handler should
  return a new seed.
  One of the PI-TAGs may be the symbol \*DEFAULT\*. The corresponding
  handler will handle PIs that no other handler will. If the
  \*DEFAULT\* PI-TAG is not specified, ssax:make-pi-parser will assume
  the default handler that skips the body of the PI

The output of the `ssax:make-pi-parser` is a

	``procedure _PORT_ _PI-TAG_ _SEED_``

that will parse the current PI according to the user-specified handlers.


###### [!Macro] `ssax:make-elem-parser`  _my-new-level-seed_ _my-finish-element_ _my-char-data-handler_ _my-pi-handlers_

Create a parser to parse and process one element, including its
character content or children elements. The parser is typically
applied to the root element of a document.

_my-new-level-seed_
: procedure ELEM-GI ATTRIBUTES NAMESPACES EXPECTED-CONTENT SEED
  	where ELEM-GI is a RES-NAME of the element
  	about to be processed.
  This procedure is to generate the seed to be passed
  to handlers that process the content of the element.
  This is the function identified as 'fdown' in the denotational
  semantics of the XML parser given in the title comments to this
  file.

_my-finish-element_
: procedure ELEM-GI ATTRIBUTES NAMESPACES PARENT-SEED SEED
  This procedure is called when parsing of ELEM-GI is finished.
  The SEED is the result from the last content parser (or
  from my-new-level-seed if the element has the empty content).
  PARENT-SEED is the same seed as was passed to my-new-level-seed.
  The procedure is to generate a seed that will be the result
  of the element parser.
  This is the function identified as 'fup' in the denotational
  semantics of the XML parser given in the title comments to this
  file.

_my-char-data-handler_
: A STR-HANDLER

_my-pi-handlers_
: See ssax:make-pi-handler above

The generated parser is a
``procedure _START-TAG-HEAD_ _PORT_ _ELEMS_ _ENTITIES_	 _NAMESPACES_ _PRESERVE-WS?_ _SEED_``

The procedure must be called after the start tag token has been
read. START-TAG-HEAD is an UNRES-NAME from the start-element tag.
ELEMS is an instance of xml-decl::elems.

###### [!Macro] `ssax:make-parser`  _user-handler-tag_ _user-handler-proc_ _..._

Create an XML parser, an instance of the XML parsing framework.
This will be a SAX, a DOM, or a specialized parser depending
on the supplied user-handlers.

user-handler-tag is a symbol that identifies a procedural expression
that follows the tag. Given below are tags and signatures of the
corresponding procedures. Not all tags have to be specified. If some
are omitted, reasonable defaults will apply.

tag: DOCTYPE
handler-procedure: PORT DOCNAME SYSTEMID INTERNAL-SUBSET? SEED
: If internal-subset? is #t, the current position in the port
  is right after we have read #\\[ that begins the internal DTD subset.
  We must finish reading of this subset before we return
  (or must call skip-internal-subset if we aren't interested in reading it).
  The port at exit must be at the first symbol after the whole
  DOCTYPE declaration.
  The _handler-procedure_ must generate four values:
  	ELEMS ENTITIES NAMESPACES SEED
  See xml-decl::elems for ELEMS. It may be #f to switch off the validation.
  NAMESPACES will typically contain USER-PREFIXes for selected URI-SYMBs.
  The default handler-procedure skips the internal subset,
  if any, and returns (values #f '() '() seed)

tag: UNDECL-ROOT
handler-procedure ELEM-GI SEED
: where ELEM-GI is an UNRES-NAME of the root element. This procedure
  is called when an XML document under parsing contains _no_ DOCTYPE
  declaration.
  The _handler-procedure_, as a DOCTYPE handler procedure above,
  must generate four values:
  	ELEMS ENTITIES NAMESPACES SEED
  The default handler-procedure returns (values #f '() '() seed)

tag: DECL-ROOT
handler-procedure ELEM-GI SEED
: where ELEM-GI is an UNRES-NAME of the root element. This procedure
  is called when an XML document under parsing does contains the DOCTYPE
  declaration.
  The handler-procedure must generate a new SEED (and verify
  that the name of the root element matches the doctype, if the handler
  so wishes). 
  The default _handler-procedure_ is the identity function.

tag: NEW-LEVEL-SEED
handler-procedure
: see `ssax:make-elem-parser`, my-new-level-seed

tag: FINISH-ELEMENT
handler-procedure
: see `ssax:make-elem-parser`, my-finish-element

tag: CHAR-DATA-HANDLER
handler-procedure
: see `ssax:make-elem-parser`, my-char-data-handler

tag: PI
handler-procedure
: see `ssax:make-pi-parser`The default value is '()
  The generated parser is a
  	procedure PORT SEED
  This procedure parses the document prolog and then exits to
  an element parser (created by `ssax:make-elem-parser`) to handle
  the rest.

``````````scheme
[1]  document ::=  prolog element Misc*
[22] prolog ::= XMLDecl? Misc* (doctypedec | Misc*)?

### [ยง3] Highest-level parsers: XML to SXML {#ssax.user.api}

First, a few utility procedures that turned out useful

###### [!Function] `ssax:reverse-collect-str`  _list-of-frags_

given the list of fragments (some of which are text strings)
reverse the list and concatenate adjacent text strings.
We can prove from the general case below that if LIST-OF-FRAGS
has zero or one element, the result of the procedure is equal?
to its argument. This fact justifies the shortcut evaluation below.


###### [!Function] `ssax:reverse-collect-str-drop-ws`  _list-of-frags_

given the list of fragments (some of which are text strings)
reverse the list and concatenate adjacent text strings.
We also drop "unsignificant" whitespace, that is, whitespace
in front, behind and between elements. The whitespace that
is included in character data is not affected.
We use this procedure to "intelligently" drop "insignificant"
whitespace in the parsed SXML. If the strict compliance with
the XML Recommendation regarding the whitespace is desired, please
use the `ssax:reverse-collect-str` procedure instead.


###### [!Function] `ssax:xml->sxml`  _port_ _namespaces_

This is an instance of a SSAX parser above that returns an SXML
representation of the XML document to be read from PORT.
NAMESPACE-PREFIX-ASSIG is a list of (USER-PREFIX . URI-STRING)
that assigns USER-PREFIXes to certain namespaces identified by
particular URI-STRINGs. It may be an empty list.
The procedure returns an SXML tree. The port points out to the
first character after the root element.
