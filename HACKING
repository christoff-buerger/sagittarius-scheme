# How to build HEAD code

To build HEAD code, you need the latest release of Sagittarius Scheme. So
first please install it.

## Provided developer tool

We provide `dist.sh` for developer and it generates boot code, VM
instructions and generated code from stub file.

## Generate code

To generate code you need to execute following commands;

    % ./dist.sh stub
    % ./dist.sh precomp
    % ./dist.sh srfi

Or this command does the same;

    % ./dist.sh gen

These commands generate C files from stub files and Scheme files respectively.
This must be run *before* CMake command otherwise CMake process will fail.

To clean the generated code, you need to execute following command;

    % ./dist.sh clean
